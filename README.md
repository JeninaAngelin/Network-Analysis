### Background

You are enhancing security on two access switches in a partially configured network. You will implement the 
range of security measures that were covered in this module according to the requirements below. Note that 
routing has been configured on this network, so connectivity between hosts on different VLANs should 
function when completed.

### The tool used: Cisco Packet Tracer

Cisco Packet Tracer is a network simulation and visualization tool developed by Cisco Systems. It is widely used to design, configure, and troubleshoot computer networks for educational and training purposes. Packet Tracer allows users to create virtual network topologies, connect devices, and simulate network behavior without the need for physical hardware.

### Network Mapping  (with Cisco Packet Tracer)

Network mapping refers to the process of creating a visual representation of a computer network's structure, layout, and connectivity. It involves discovering and documenting various network elements, such as devices, routers, switches, servers, and their interconnections. 
The main purpose of network mapping is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the network's topology, allowing network administrators, engineers, or security professionals to manage, troubleshoot, and secure the network effectively. Here, we use Cisco Packet Tracer for the purpose. The following rooms of the Institute are considered for the network analysis.

### Learnings:

Role of Routers and Switches:
Routers focus on interconnecting multiple networks and making intelligent forwarding decisions based on IP addresses at the network layer. On the other hand, switches are responsible for local network connectivity and use MAC addresses at the data link layer to efficiently forward data frames within the same LAN, while reducing collision domains and creating a single broadcast domain. Both devices play critical roles in ensuring effective and scalable network communication.The switch is the network equipment to which all the computers are connected. A switch can be configured so the clients cannot connect to each other, to limit communication to groups created for a specific project and to grant or refuse access to external resources.

#### Functions of Servers
The function of a server is to receive, store, and share data. From there, you can run virus scans, manage spam filters, and install programs across the network. That makes network security management a lot less demanding, even when you have more members on your team. The server can also be used to filter the external information the clients can access, for example, blocking Facebook but leaving the Library of Congress accessible. The server can also store the profile of each student and back up their work from session to session.The researchers concluded that having a server for the computer laboratory will help the facilitator manage and maintain the security of the client's computers, such as monitoring applications, proper file sharing, and data keeping for better computer laboratory management.

#### Access ports
An access port is a type of switch port that is assigned to a specific VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network). Its primary function is to provide network connectivity to end-user devices, such as computers, printers, IP phones, and other network peripherals, within a local area network (LAN). 

#### Other End Devices
In Cisco Packet Tracer, end devices refer to network devices that serve as the sources or destinations of data packets in a simulated network. These devices are usually located at the edges of the network and represent devices that users interact with directly.

## Attack Surface Mapping
Attack surface mapping is a process used to identify and analyze potential points of vulnerability in a system, application, or network that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or compromise the security of the target. By understanding and mapping the attack surface, organizations can proactively assess and strengthen their security defenses to reduce the risk of successful cyber-attacks.

#### The "ping" command

When a user enters the "ping" command in the command-line interface (CLI) of a device, they specify the IP address or hostname of the destination device they want to test. The "ping" command sends an ICMP Echo Request message from the source device to the destination device, and the destination device responds with an ICMP Echo Reply message. It displays the result of the communication test, showing the number of packets sent, received, lost (if any), and the minimum, maximum, and average RTT values. The results help network administrators assess the quality of the network link and identify potential issues, such as high latency or packet loss.

#### ARP Tables

Manage the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache. By using "arp -d", you can delete entries from the ARP cache, and with "arp -a", you can view the contents of the ARP cache, which provides information about the IP-to-MAC address mappings. When attempting to ping one PC from the other, the ping operation fails. The objective is to investigate the reason behind this failed ping, despite the direct connection between the computers. We observe that the ARP resolution is not occurring, leading to the failure of the ping. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is responsible for mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses. In this case, since the computers are on different subnets, they are not in the same broadcast domain. As a result, the ARP messages from one PC cannot reach the other PC, preventing the MAC address resolution and subsequent successful communication.

This situation highlights the need for routers. Routers are devices that operate at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and facilitate communication between different subnets or networks. By connecting the two computers through a router, it can perform the necessary routing functions, including ARP resolution between subnets. This enables successful communication between devices on different subnets by forwarding packets between them.

#### MAC table

Performing "ping" tests between neighbouring computers to verifies connectivity. Additionally, we will explore the MAC table in the switch and gain an understanding of its fundamental functionalities such as learning, flooding, and forwarding. 

#### RIB
The RIB is a database that contains routing information, including static routes, dynamic routes, and administrative distance values. It helps the router determine the best path for forwarding packets based on the destination IP address.

#### OSPF

We will utilize OSPF-specific show commands to examine how OSPF works. These commands provide insights into OSPF's behavior, including the OSPF neighbor relationships, the states of OSPF interfaces, and the OSPF routing table. By using the show ip route command, we can check the resulting IP route table, which contains information about OSPF-learned routes and their associated next hops.
By configuring OSPF, analyzing the OSPF show commands, examining the IP route table, and reviewing the show ip int brief table, we can gain a deeper understanding of how OSPF facilitates efficient routing within a network and how it dynamically builds the routing table to determine the best paths for packet forwarding.

## Secure Access Controls
The setup involves connecting the computers to the switch, which in turn is connected to the router, thereby enabling communication between the two networks.
#### Create Secure Trunks:
To enhance security, it is recommended to disable DTP on trunk ports and explicitly configure them as trunk ports. [ Iâ€™ve pasted some terminal commands which I implemented in the CLI of some switches]
<pre>
  Switch(config-if)# switchport nonegotiate
  Switch(config-if)# switchport mode trunk 
  Switch(config-if)# switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q</pre>
Manually configure trunk ports on both ends of the link with the appropriate trunking encapsulation. Specify the allowed VLANs on the trunk using the following commands.
<pre>
  switchport trunk allowed vlan 
  Switch(config-if)# switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30
  Switch(config)# vlan pruning
</pre>Some switches support trunk port security to limit the number of MAC addresses allowed on a trunk port. This feature helps prevent MAC address spoofing and unauthorized devices from connecting to trunk ports.
<pre>
  Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security maximum 5 
  Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security violation {shutdown | restrict | protect}
</pre>Disable any trunk ports that are not in use. If a trunk port is not needed, it's best to shut it down to reduce the attack surface.
<pre>
  Switch(config-if)# shutdown
</pre>

#### Secure Unused SwitchPorts
Given below are the steps to disable unused switch ports.
Open the created network topology with Cisco Packet Tracer 
Click on the switch to open the configuration options.
Access the CLI of the switch by clicking on the "CLI" tab at the bottom of the switch configuration window.
Enter the global configuration mode by typing enable and then configure terminal:
<pre>Switch> enable
  Switch# configure terminal
  Switch(config)# interface FastEthernet0/1
  Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security
  Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security mac-address 0011.2233.4455
  Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security violation shutdown
</pre>Exit the interface configuration mode and save the configuration
<pre>
  Switch(config-if)# end 
  Switch# write memory</pre>
Now, if an unauthorized device with a MAC address not listed in the allowed list tries to connect to the port, port security will be triggered based on the violation mode you set.

#### Implement Port Security
Private VLANs provide additional isolation and segregation within a single VLAN. PVLANs restrict communication between certain ports within the same VLAN, enhancing security and preventing lateral movement between devices.
The Port Status of the unused one can be turned OFF. This is a simple method of ensuring Port Security. But there are other methods to ensure similar actions. VLAN pruning is an optional step to limit unnecessary broadcast traffic on trunk links. 
One another is using commands for the same action performed in the first technique. It simply requires the keyword â€˜shutdownâ€™. However, directly using this type of switching them down is not always preferred.
<pre>
  Switch(config-if)# switchport port-security violation protect
  Switch(config)# vlan pruning
</pre>
