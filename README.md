## Problem Statement:

Choose a university/college campus and analyze its network topology. Map the network using Cisco Packet Tracer and identify the security controls that are in place, such as network segmentation, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and authentication and authorization systems. Apply the knowledge gained from the NetAcad cyber security course to conduct an attack surface mapping to identify potential entry points for cyber-attacks. Propose countermeasures to mitigate these risks.

### The tool used: Cisco Packet Tracer

Cisco Packet Tracer is a network simulation and visualization tool developed by Cisco Systems. It is widely used to design, configure, and troubleshoot computer networks for educational and training purposes. Packet Tracer allows users to create virtual network topologies, connect devices, and simulate network behavior without the need for physical hardware.
